etto
===

A small, customizable autocomplete and select component. Some highlights:

* Lightweight (~4kb min+gzip)
* Written in ES6+
* Zero dependencies
* Framework agnostic

This a replacement for my earlier component, [otto](https://github.com/kevinfiol/otto). I wanted to get rid of the Hyperapp dependency, but also simplify the codebase and features. I advise you use etto over otto.

Etto is named after [a friend of mine](https://github.com/ettore34).
